This is my HTML project: to build a basic recipe website

# My Recipe Website

## Introduction
Welcome to my first HTML project! This is a basic recipe website where I'll be showcasing some of my favorite recipes. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and how to structure we pages.

## Project Overview
In this project, I'll be creating a simple website with a few recipe pages. Each recipe page will include ingredients, instructions, and possibly some images. I'll also ensure that the website is easy to navigate.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Understanding of HTML tags and their usage.
- Structuring web pages using HTML elements.
- Creating multiple pages, adding images and linking the pages together.

## Future Enhancements
Once I've completed the basic version of the website, I plan to add more features such as:
- Search functionality to easily find recipes.
- Responsive design for better viewing on different devices.
- Integration with JavaScript for interactive elements.
